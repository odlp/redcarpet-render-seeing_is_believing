# Redcarpet::Render::SeeingIsBelieving

Powerup the Ruby examples in your markdown. Combines the excellent
[Redcarpet][redcarpet] (a markdown parser) with [Seeing Is Believing][sib],
which evaluates each line of code.

[redcarpet]: https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet
[sib]: https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing

## TODO

- Ignore exceptions / failed evaluations by default
- Allow comments to be scoped to specific lines
